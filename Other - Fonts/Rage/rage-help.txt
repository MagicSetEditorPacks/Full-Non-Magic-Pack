__What is it for?__

This plugin for MSE allows you to build custom Rage cards that actually look like Rage cards but can be built in seconds.

__How do I get started?__

a) Download MSE to your computer
b) Uncompress this package to the c:\Program Files\Magic Set Editor 2\data folder (or the equivalent if you installed MSE elsewhere).
c) Install the fonts in the rage-installation

Now when you run MSE, you have an option for Rage Apocalypse. There are two versions, Rage Apocalypse (Original White Wolf) and New Template (used for Fan sets from 2013, designed by Zita).

__How do I make a card?__

a) Click on Add Card (at the right of the top toolbar)
b) Click on the card frame (anywhere that is not in a dotted field) and change the card type to what you want.
c) Fill in the fields presented by dotted lines.  Note that some fields are generated by selection (i.e. Set and Character Traits), but most are typed by hand.
	- The Ally template does have Rage/Gnosis/Health fields but they are hard to see.
	- You can customise the Breed field, but it only remembers it if the icon is set to Other.
d) Edit your Set info (i.e. details about the set you are creating)
e) Save your set (File > Save)
f) Export it to your friends as individual JPEGs.

__I want to add my own set__

You need to create a set Symbol using the Edit button on the Set info tab.

__I can't find 7th Generation__

This plugin follows the current rules available at http://www.werepenguin.net/rage/rules/.  7th Generation are now considered a subset of Cults, and their caste is put in the main text box.  New Cultists won't be given Aspects.  If you want to make your cards differently, you need to edit the files in ~data\rage-trait-marks.mse-include in the same way as in the previous question.

__There are white spaces__

Unfortunately, Rage does not have any electronic originals to work from.  All Rage templates are reverse engineered from current cards, and they are not always perfect.  The Silent Strider and Pentex templates, for instance, are particularly off-centre compared to the other characters.  If you can reverse engineer better images (templates or glyphs), you are welcome to share them with the community.  Templates are found in ~data/rage-standard.mse-style.

The original template is missing blanks for Stargazers, Cults and Unbound.
The new template is missing Unbound.
